  <p class="background"><span class="fancy">L</span>ets start with a little bit about my background. Born and raised half my life in California I enjoyed the experience of having to move to new cities because of my military parents. After moving to Washington in 2008 I enrolled into a community college with the hopes of getting into the programming scene. Unfortunately due to family matters I was not able to finish this and had to move out of state. Now back in Washington in 2019 I've chosen to take up programming again in the hopes to gain a solid career in tech.</p>
